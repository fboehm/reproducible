```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  eval = FALSE
)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)
```

```{r}
create_package(path = "tweets") 
# created a directory 'tweets' in the current working directory
# creates empty subdirectory "R" and files "DESCRIPTION" and "NAMESPACE". 
# Files "DESCRIPTION" and "NAMESPACE" are populated with initial values
# You will need to edit "DESCRIPTION" by hand 
# File "NAMESPACE" shouldn't be edited by hand. Instead, we'll use the R package "Roxygen2" to automate creation of a new "NAMESPACE" file. 
# this function also changes the working directory to 'tweets'

```
